These are my efforts in porting the `FHEM <http://fhem.de/fhem.html>`_
`Duofern USB-Stick <https://wiki.fhem.de/wiki/DUOFERN>`_ based module to
`Homeassistant <https://home-assistant.io/>`_. As of now the port is rather ugly, but it is usable enough to control
my Duofern blinds. I did not port the Weather-Station related features of the original module -- Mainly because I
do not own the corresponding hardware and have no means to test if it works. I only tested it with the model
*RolloTron Standard DuoFern 14233011 Funk-Gurtwickler Aufputz*.

I do not provide any guarantees for the usability of this software. Use at your own risk.

Setup custom component
=======================

Put the cover component file to your custom_components folder::

    config\custom_components\cover\duofern.py

After restarting HA the necessary python module will be installed automatically from GitHub

Put the duofern addon to your addons folder::

    addons\duofern\Dockerfile
    addons\duofern\config.json
    addons\duofern\run.sh

Setup addon
===============

To access the DuoFern Stick inside the addon, it must be mapped in the config.json file::

    addons\duofern\config.json

In my installation the DuoFern Stick is "/dev/ttyUSB2" and I just map it with the same name into the addon::

    "devices": ["/dev/ttyUSB2:/dev/ttyUSB2:rwm"],

For minimum changes to other files I suggest to just change the name of the duoFern Stick in the host system.


Pairing Devices
===============

Pairing is done via starting the addon, basically it just runs::

    python3 /share/pyduofern/scripts/duofern_cli.py --configfile /config/duofern.json --device /dev/ttyUSB2 --pair --pairtime 60

Renaming is currently not supported via addon, I just change the names manually in::

    config/duofern.json
    ...
    "devices": [
        {
            "id": "123456",
            "name": "YourName"
        }
    ],


Indexing paired blinds is not supported yet

Usage with Homeassistant
========================

Just add the roller shutters to your configuration::
    
    cover.yourname
    
Known issues
============

During initial setup I had issues pairing via addon while the duofern custom component was already configured.
Maybe the addon couldn't use the DuoFern Stick since it was already in use by the custom component.
If you experience this issue just remove the DuoFern component from the HA config and restart.
