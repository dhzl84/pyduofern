These are my efforts in porting the `FHEM <http://fhem.de/fhem.html>`_
`Duofern USB-Stick <https://wiki.fhem.de/wiki/DUOFERN>`_ based module to
`Homeassistant <https://home-assistant.io/>`_. As of now the port is rather ugly, but it is usable enough to control
my Duofern blinds. I did not port the Weather-Station related features of the original module -- Mainly because I
do not own the corresponding hardware and have no means to test if it works. I only tested it with the model
*RolloTron Standard DuoFern 14233011 Funk-Gurtwickler Aufputz*.

I do not provide any guarantees for the usability of this software. Use at your own risk.

Getting Started
===============

Put the cover component file to your custom_components folder::

    config\custom_components\cover\duofern.py

After restarting HA the necessary python module will be installed automatically from GitHub.

Getting Started
===============
To start using your stick you can use the ``duofern_cli.py`` script which should have been installed together
with the pyduofern module. Begin by choosing a 4 hex-digit system code. Ideally write it down, if you forget
it, you will likely have to chose a new system code and reset your devices in order to be able to pair them again.
It is also a security feature which is why no default is provided.

Decide for a system configuration file. By default it will reside as a hidden config file in your home directory in
``~/.duofern.json``. Pass the config file to ``duofern_cli.py`` via the command line option ``--configfile``.
The default has the advantage that you do not always have to pass the config file when using the script. Initialize
the config file with your system code with the following command::

   duofern_cli.py --code <your chosen 4 digit hex code here>
   # or if you prefer your own configfile location
   doufern_cli.py --code <your chosen 4 digit hex code here> --configfile <your config file path>

Now RTFM of the shutter to find out how to start pairing. Set the maximum and minimum positions according to the manual.
If you want to experiment with the shutter first, chose the two positions very near each other. The motors shut down
after a certain maximum runtime and you could exceed that while experimenting if you move the shutters up and down
several times unless the min and max positions are close to each other.

Start out by pairing your first rollershutter::

    duofern_cli.py --pair --pairtime 60

now initiate pairing via the buttons on your shutter. Once a shutter is paired it should show up in your
config file and you can name it. Say the blind that popped up has the ID ``408ea2``, run the following to give it
the name ``kitchen``::

    duofern_cli.py --set_name 408ea2 kitchen
    # you can now try to also have it move up or down:
    duofern_cli.py --up kitchen

Hopefully you now have working command line interface that knows how to move up or down your shutters. But the python
interface can do more, (which I was so far too lazy to expose via the command line):

Indexing paired blinds
----------------------
If you have the system code of your system but lost the list of configured blinds you can use the CLI to refresh
the config file with all paired blinds.::

    # assuming you lost the config file
    duofern_cli.py --code <your code> --refresh --refreshtime 60

will start up the stick and listen for connecting blinds for 60 seconds. It will store all the blinds that were found
in the default config file.a

Usage with Homeassistant
========================
Find an example code for using these blinds with homeassistant in the examples folder


Usage from python
=================
.. code-block:: python

    from pyduofern.duofern_stick import DuofernStick
    import time
    stick = DuofernStick(device="/dev/duofernstick") # by default looks for /dev/duofernstick
    stick_initialize() # do some initialization sequence with the stick
    stick.start() # start the stick in a thread so it keeps communicating with your blinds
    time.sleep(10) # let it settle to be able to talk to your blinds.
    # your code here
    # this uses internal variables of the duofern parser module and likely I will wrap it in
    # the future.

    print(stick.duofern_parser.modules['by_code']['1ff1d3']['position'])

    command("1ff1d3", "up") # open the blind with code 1ff1d3

    stick.command("1ff1d3", "down") # down the blind with code 1ff1d3

    stick.command("1ff1d3", "stop") # stop the blind with code 1ff1d3

    stick.command("1ff1d3", "position", 30) # set position of the blind with code 1ff1d3 to 30%

Look for an indication of possible commands in ``pyduofern/definitions.py``
I just translated them into python and did not explore what might be possible.
It looks like a lot of functionality requires a weather station, but you can just as
easily automate the stuff using your home automation and having it send the up and down
commands instead of buying a weather station.
